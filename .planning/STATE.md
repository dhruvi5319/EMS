## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Layered monolith (React + Node.js REST API + PostgreSQL) — avoids microservices complexity for single-tenant scope
- [Init]: JWT/session-cookie hybrid with DB-stored session hash for revocability
- [Init]: Granularity set to "standard" — 6 phases derived from gate progression (F0–F1 → F0 shell → F2–F3 → F4–F7 → F8–F10 → F11–F14)
- [Init]: F0 split across Phase 1 (auth/session infrastructure) and Phase 2 (full shell/nav/search/audit UI) to respect dependency order

### Pending Todos
